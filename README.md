Deliverable 3: Detecting Intrusions Using Data Mining Techniques


Maintaining the security of a network system is critical in todayâ€™s world. In order to protect
ourselves from hackers, we need a secured and safe network infrastructure. In a network, an intrusion
detection system is used to detect various forms of attacks. IDS come in a variety of configurations,
including network-based, host-based, and hybrid, depending on the technology they detect in the
market. We need a safe and reliable network system because the current system does not give that
level of security.
In this work, we study intrusion detection systems (IDS) that use a Decision Tree and Particle
Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique to efficiently identify intruder attacks.
In order to implement these mentioned data mining methods, python was used, and the also libraries
Sklearn and Zoofs libraries (for Particle Swarm Optimization-PSO) are used.
